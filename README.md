## config
a basic boolean-only config system is included using bitwise operations. the save & load buttons operate on a config file "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\singlefile.cfg", where the config is stored as a number.
## code style
this was programmed with the intention of being a single-file cheat, as well as a target line count of under 1000. i achieved both of these with the initial version i am posting.
